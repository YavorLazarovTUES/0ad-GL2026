 * 'Entering' and 'Leaving' realms must be done in a LIFO manner.
 * SM recommends using JSAutoRealm, which provides an RAII option.

 * providing safe access to the JSContext*, the global object, and ensuring that the proper realm has been entered.
 * Most scriptinterface/ functions will take a Request, to ensure proper rooting. You may sometimes
